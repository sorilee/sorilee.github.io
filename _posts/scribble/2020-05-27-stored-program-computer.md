# Stored-program computer

**Concept.** A *stored-program* computer[^1] uses its memory as the store of the instructions of a program it runs.

[^1]: **Concept.** A *universal / general-purpose computing machine* or *computer* is a machine[^2] that is capable of computing variable algorithms. In particular, fed as input to such a machine is an algorithm together with an input to the algorithm. Terminology: an algorithm that is fed to a computer is referred to as a *program*.

      'Universal computing machine' is alao the term which Turing used in his 1937 paper for the universal Turing machine as we call it today. Note that the universal Turing machine is indeed a universal computing machine in the above sense.
      
      Note also that I'm rather unspecific about the computational power a universal computing machine must possess: it needn't be Turing complete. Perhaps 'general-purpose' is a better adjective phrase in a context where 'universal' may be mistaken to connote Turing completeness.

[^2]: Be it theoretical or physical.
