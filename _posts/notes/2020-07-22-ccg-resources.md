# CCG computational resources

Here I list computational resources on CCG.

## Software

**EasyCCG.**

- A CCG parser. Product of a 2014 research.
  - Written in Java.

- Web demo: [http://4.easy-ccg.appspot.com/](http://4.easy-ccg.appspot.com/do_parse?sentence=Fruit+flies+like+a+banana&nbest=5)

- Availability:

  - Source & binaries: <https://github.com/mikelewis0/easyccg>
    - Last updated on 11 Jul 2015, as of writing.

  - Pre-trained models:[^1] <https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B7AY6PGZ8lc-NGVOcUFXNU5VWXc>

  - A [fork](https://github.com/stormysmoke/easyccg) by [QuantumSense](https://quantumsense.ai/). Seems to be an adaptation of EasyCCG for their products[^2].
