# Materials on logic and theorem proving

Upon the request of a colleague at Tmax, I list up some introductory materials
on logic (and some also on theorem proving). The choice is very personal.

**Lean's 'Logic and Proof' manuscript by Avigad, Lewis and van Doorn.**

- It's a very friendly introduction to logic and at the same time to the use of
  a (particular) proof assistant.
- Especially recommended as a starting place if you are not yet familiar with
  mathematical proofs themselves.

**Paulson's 'Logic and Proof' course.**

- It's the 2019-2020 edition of Larry Paulson's Cambridge Part IB (second-year)
  CS course 'Logic and Proof'.
- This course covers some basic techniques for theorem proving, such as
  unification, first-order resolution and tableaux methods.

- Lecture Notes: <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1920/LogicProof/logic-notes.pdf>
- Lecture Slides: <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1920/LogicProof/logic-slides.pdf>

**Moerdijk and van Oosten's 'Sets, Models and Proofs'.**

- This is a textbook for an introductory course on mathematical logic. I was
  taught logic by the second-named author with (an earlier version of) these
  notes. Suitable for advanced maths undergraduates.
- Covers the basics of model theory (the model theory of first-order logic),
  proof theory and set theory.
- Book info: <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319924137>

**Johnstone's 'Notes on Logic and Set Theory'.**

- This book is a succinct compilation of the fundamentals of mathematical logic.
  Suitable for advanced maths undergraduates.
- Covers the basics of model theory (the model theory of first-order logic),
  computability theory (traditionally called recursion theory) and set theory.

**Lambek and Scott's 'Introduction to higher-order categorical logic'.**

- An important work that introduces the reader to the subject of categorical
  logic. One will be exposed to categories and type theories (simply typed
  lambda-calculus and many-sorted logic).
- I'm inserting this one to the list, as my colleague specifically asked for
  preliminaries to homotopy type theory. Well, it's not a necesssary preliminary
  depending on what one wants, but unarguably a very useful one.
