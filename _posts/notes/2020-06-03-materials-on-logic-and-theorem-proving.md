# Materials on logic and theorem proving

Upon a colleague's request, I list up some introductory materials on logic (and
some also on automated theorem proving). The choices are very personal.

**Lean's 'Logic and Proof' manuscript by Avigad, Lewis and van Doorn.**

- It's a friendly introduction to logic and at the same time to the use of
  a (particular) proof assistant.
- Especially recommended as a starting place if you are not yet familiar with
  mathematical proofs themselves.
- Manuscript on web: <https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/>
- PDF version: <https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/logic_and_proof.pdf>

**Paulson's 'Logic and Proof' course.**

- The 2019-2020 edition of Larry Paulson's Cambridge Part IB (i.e. second-year
  undergraduate) CS course 'Logic and Proof'.
- This course covers some basic techniques for automated theorem proving, such
  as unification, first-order resolution and tableaux methods.
- Course website: <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1920/LogicProof/>
- Lecture notes: <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1920/LogicProof/logic-notes.pdf>
- Lecture slides: <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1920/LogicProof/logic-slides.pdf>

**Moerdijk and van Oosten's 'Sets, Models and Proofs'.**

- This is a textbook for an introductory course on mathematical logic. Suitable
  for advanced maths undergraduates.
- Covers the basics of model theory, proof theory and set theory.
- Book info: <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319924137>
- Personalia: I was taught logic by its second-named author with (an earlier
  version of) these notes.

**Johnstone's 'Notes on Logic and Set Theory'.**

- This book is a succinct compilation of the fundamentals of mathematical logic.
  Suitable for advanced maths undergraduates.
- Covers the basics of model theory, computability theory (traditionally called
  recursion theory) and set theory.
- Book info: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/notes-on-logic-and-set-theory/A4D56347336629DBFC20710AF214B245>

**Lambek and Scott's 'Introduction to higher-order categorical logic'.**

- An important work that introduces its readers to the subject of categorical
  logic. One will be exposed to categories and type theories (simply typed
  lambda calculus and many-sorted logics) along the way.
- I'm including this one in the list, because my colleague specifically asked
  for preliminaries to homotopy type theory. Well, it's not a necesssary
  priliminary depending on what one wants, but undoubtedly a very useful one.
